\begin{rSection}{Research Interests}
%From data that is being used to train models to making decisions with the help of models, humans are heavily involved throughout the machine learning lifecycle. I am interested in studying how humans interact with models in this lifecycle. Recently, I have focused on studying human involvement in the context of interpretability and fairness. My long-term ambition is to leverage insights from these studies for creating systems that foster an effective and responsible collaboration between humans and models.
I am interested in the interaction between humans and machine learning systems. Because of the heavy involvement of humans throughout the machine learning lifecycle---from getting data that is necessary to train models to making decisions with the help of models---it is becoming more and more important to study humans and machines jointly. My research builds on principles and methodologies from HCI, psychology, and social sciences on human-subject experiments to study human behavior when they interact with machine learning systems. Recently, I have focused on studying this interaction in the context of interpretability and fairness. My long-term ambition is to leverage insights from these studies for creating systems that foster an effective and responsible collaboration between humans and models.
